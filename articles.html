                    BURAUEN, Leyte ‚Äî The Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) on Thursday released two more Philippine eagles into the Anonang-Lobi mountain range in a continued effort to repopulate the critically endangered species in the province.<br>Kalatungan I, a 3-year-old male eagle, was the first to soar out of a 10-by-10-foot hack cage at 9:32 a.m. Friday. The second eagle, an 11-year-old female named Lyra Sinabadan, followed at 10:37 a.m., more than an hour later.<br>Both birds were rescued in Bukidnon and arrived in Burauen on March 21. They are part of a broader initiative to reintroduce the national bird into Leyte‚Äôs forests.<br>Conservationists made history first on June 28, 2024, by releasing a pair of Philippine eagles into the area. Kalatungan I and Lyra Sinabadan are the second mated pair to be released under the program.<br>The eagles underwent a medical checkup Tuesday night near their hack cage. They were declared fit for release by veterinarian Sheen Erica Gadong.<br>Kalatungan I, Lyra Sinabadan, and another male eagle named Lakpue made an 18-hour land trip from Davao City to Leyte on March 21 as part of the ongoing Philippine eagle reintroduction effort.
