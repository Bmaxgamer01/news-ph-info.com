                    From ancient Malay settlements to Spanish colonization, the American occupation and beyond, A History of the Philippines recasts various Philippine narratives with an eye for the layers of colonial and post-colonial history that have created this diverse and fascinating population. A History of the Philippines begins with the pre-Westernized Philippines in the 16th century and continues through the 1899 Philippine-American War, the nation's relationship with the United States‚Äô controlling presence, culminating with its independence in 1946 and two ongoing insurgencies, one Islamic and one Communist. Luis H. Francia creates an illuminating portrait that offers the reader valuable insights into the heart and soul of the modern Filipino, laying bare the multicultural, multiracial society of contemporary times.</td>

            <td valign="top">A fascinating and enlightening look at the world‚Äôs oldest and most mysterious institution, written by an American journalist with unparalleled knowledge about the Vatican's past and present.

                The sexual abuse scandals that shook American and British Catholicism in 2002 brought to light a long-standing cultural gap between the English-speaking Catholic world and the Vatican. In Rome, the crisis was often seen as an attack on the Church mounted by money-hungry lawyers, a hostile press, and liberal activists who used it as a way to turn attention on such concerns as celibacy, women‚Äôs ordination, and lay empowerment. When the Vatican struck down the U.S. bishops‚Äô draft for handling allegations of sexual abuse, many saw it as an attempt to curb an independent American Catholic church. Yet, as time passed, it became clear that the Vatican‚Äôs well-founded concerns about due process were shared by most liberal U.S. bishops and canon lawyers.
                
                ALL THE POPE‚ÄôS MEN is a lucid, in-depth guide to the sometimes puzzling, often incomprehensible inner workings of the Vatican. It reveals how decisions are made, how papal bureaucrats think, and how careers in the Roman Curia are shaped. It debunks the myths that have fed the distrust and suspicions many English-speaking Catholics harbor about the way the Vatican conducts its business, explains who really wields the power, and offers entertaining profiles of the personalities, historical and present-day, who have wielded that power for good and for bad. A thoughtful analysis of the recent sexual abuse crisis sheds light on how the Vatican perceives the Church in the United States.
                
                Balanced, lively, and filled with Vatican history and lore, ALL THE POPE‚ÄôS MEN provides the general reader with an authoritative picture of the highly charged relationship between the Vatican and the richest, most influential national Catholic church in the world today.

                    ‚ÄúOne of my favorite authors.‚Äù‚ÄîColleen Hoover
                    One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming...
                    Nora Stephens' life is books‚Äîshe‚Äôs read them all‚Äîand she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.
                    
                    Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters‚Äô trip away‚Äîwith visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she‚Äôs convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they‚Äôve met many times and it‚Äôs never been cute.
                    
                    If Nora knows she‚Äôs not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs hero, but as they are thrown together again and again‚Äîin a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow‚Äîwhat they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they‚Äôve written about themselves.
